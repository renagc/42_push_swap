# Push_swap

Push_swap is a project that involves sorting data on a stack using a limited set of instructions, with the objective of achieving the lowest possible number of actions. The goal is to manipulate various types of algorithms and select the most suitable solution for optimized data sorting.

## Introduction

The Push_swap project is a simple algorithm project that focuses on sorting data. The objective is to write a program, called push_swap, in C that calculates and displays the smallest program (made of Push_swap language instructions) to sort a given list of integers. The project emphasizes the understanding of complexity and the use of basic algorithms.

## Objectives

The main objectives of the project are to develop skills in writing sorting algorithms, understanding complexity, and using the C programming language effectively. Sorting values is a straightforward task, but finding the most efficient sorting solution can vary depending on the initial configuration of the integers.

## Mandatory part

The mandatory part of the project provides details about the rules, examples, and the "push_swap" program. It explains the stack operations available (such as swap, push, rotate, and reverse rotate) and provides an example of how these operations can be used to sort a list of integers.
